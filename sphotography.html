    Photography for me has always been about expressing myself , street photography is one of my favourite genre
    of photography.
    street photography is very similar to candid photography as a photographer street photography gives me 
    immense satisfaction as when you are in the street trying to capture a candid moment all the external conditions 
    are aganst you like you might have to set the shutter speed in a second because you will miss the shot if the 
    subject moves its not like in potrait , in potrait photography you have the freedom to wait and adjust the lightings 
    and even tell the subject to move as per your choice.Thus ,street photography is a great genre to begin your journey 
    as a photographer as  when one can play well with the light in challenging conditions , one might end up doing 
    great in other genres when you have greater controll over light .
    street photography has produced fe great photographers over the years like Raghunath Rai Chowdhry  
    He was a protégé of Henri Cartier-Bresson who is called the father of street photography.
    street photgraphy records the nuiances of everyday life when we look at a picture that brings back a memory
    of how this place looked in the past, what did people do here everyday . it creates a picture into the past
