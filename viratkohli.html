<h1>virat kohli , we all know the brand he has established for himself in the last decade while playing for india,not 
    just the brand though he has had a diffrent impact on the youth as well.
    When we think about his life how his father passed away at such a young age of 18 and despite that he  
    played a cricket match on that same  day scoring 90 runs  in an interview that i saw i remember virat saying 
    how he felt like it was a sin to miss practice in his mind, or how in his lastest interviews he has mentioned 
    that it wasnt like when he promised to himself that he wouldnt make mistakes or just stopped making mistakes 
    , he revieled how there were times he felt like giving up but he again picked himself up and tried again.
    
    virat kohli was also a very aggresive batsman in his younger days but he showed maturity even after the faliure
    of kohli in 2014 he came back strongly in 2018 in england.In 2012 after a very bad season in ipl virat stated that
    he was disgusted by what he looked in the mirror and deciede to loose weight after that leading from the front 
    he ended up setting great fitness standards for the team.


    Recently virat lost his ODI captaincy and gave up the t20 captaincy few months back , his fans are desperately
    waiting for his 71st century, i hope that virat comes back stronger like he used to in his younger days and 
    continues to inspire the youth.

    when he does come back it will be great to see how he rediscoveres himself and his role as a senior player and 
    as a batsman in the team.
